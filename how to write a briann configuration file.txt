# How to write a BrIANN configuration file

- The file is written in JSON format

## Connections
Specify a list of connection data entries using the key "connections"

## Area
Specify a list of area data entries using the key "areas".
- Source areas are special areas with the below parameters. A source does not support for incoming connections and it does not support any transformation of the data inside of it. It therefore does not use a state merge strategy.
    - "index": The index of the area. This has to be set to 0.
    - "update_rate": A float indicating the rate at which the area shall process its inputs, given in Hz.
    - "cool_down_duration": A float indicating how many seconds the source area shall hold the last actual time-frame to let the other areas finish processing.
    - "hold_function": (optional, see SourceArea documentation).
- Target area are special areas that need all parameters that a regular area needs (see below). For the "transformation" parameter, a simple strategy is recommended, such as averaging across time frames within each input buffer and then adding all results elementwise across the different inputs, hence no weights and biases needed. 
- Any regular area needs to have the following parameters:
    - "index": The index of the area. This should be a unique integer in the range from 0 to n-1, where n is the number of areas including the source and target. 
    - "initial_state": A string of python code that, once executed, gives the initial state for a single instance, e.g. "torch.zeros(3)".
    - "transformation": A string of python code that, once executed, gives the the transformation that should be applied to all instances at each step of the area. This can set up by simply calling the constructor of a custom torch.nn.Module that is specified in the components.py file, e.g. "TimeAverageThenStateConcatenateThenTransformLinear(input_dimensionality=5, output_dimensionality=3)".
    - "update_rate": A float indicating the rate at which the area shall process its inputs, given in Hz.
